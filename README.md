Learning how to use Github ğŸ’›

I am finally joining the GitHub family and venturing into front-end web design and development. ğŸ˜Š. Even thou' 2020 has been a challenging year. I am lucky to have the ability to learn a new skill and to have access to excellent resources like this. I love the open-source nature of GitHub and what it represents. Can't wait to contribute ğŸ•¹
